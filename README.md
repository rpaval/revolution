This repository includes the R script that was used to analyse data from the REVOLUTION trial. 

The script includes 2 types of models: a Bayesian ordinal regression model and a generalised linear model. 

The ordinal regression model was used to examine if adipokines (i.e., adiponectin, resistin, intelectin-1 and leptin) can predict mGPS scores and cachexia in patients with incurable cancer. 

The generalised linear model was used to determine if the level of adipokines differs between timepoints (T0 vs T1). 

The data that was used to conduct the analysis will also be added to repository once approvial is obtained.
